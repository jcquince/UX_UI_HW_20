            <h2>What is A Little Help?</h2>
            <p>
                A Little Help is a Non-Profit with a meaningful purpose of connecting older adults with their community so that they have assistance in completing daily tasks, chores, and errands; allowing them to live as independently as possible.
            </p>

<!--This is the research section-->
        <div class="research">
            <h2>The Research</h2>
            <p>
                We started our user research by thinking about what issues older people might have with modern technology. We took the approach of finding out their biggest pain points with websites, as well as some more specific questions about A Little Help’s website. The results of these questions were then grouped into categories so we could find the common denominator.

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm">
                        <p>The big takeaways from this information can be narrowed down to three key quotes:</p>
                        <p> - “I dislike over designed websites.”</p>
                        <p> - “If it’s not obvious to find my destination on the website then I won’t use it.”</p>
                        <p> - “There’s too much information on the page; the font is too small and hard to read.”</p>    
                        <p>In order to improve the site, we were going to have to focus on these issues and improve upon them. We were able to create a user persona to help us empathize with these issues and find solutions that would work to solve as many of these problems as possible.</p>

<!--This is the problem section-->
        <div class="problem">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                After conducting our first round of research we were able to determine the main problem with A Little Help’s website, it wasn’t accessible to it’s main demorgraphic; older adults.
            </p>
            <p>
                This brought us to our problem statement:
            </p>
            <p>
                How might we improve website accessibility for A Little Help so that their customers are successful based on an increase in older audlts requesting help?
            </p>
            <p>
                The solution? Redesign A Little Help’s website with more of a focus on accessibility specifically focusing on; color contrast, information legibility, and clear paths to signing up to recieve services.
            </p>

<!--This is the iteration section-->
        <div class="iteration">
            <h2 class="">Iteration & Testing</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col" id=line1>
                        <p>
                            We started by coming up with a better site layout and user flow to solve the issue of people struggling to find the signup form. We also wanted to combine a lot of extra pages, to make overall navigation of the site more straightforward.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col sitemap">
                        <img src="Images/ALHsitemapclose.png">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col userflow">
                        <img src="Images/ALHUserflow.png">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col" id="line2">
                        <p class="line2">
                            From there we knew we needed to come up with a user flow that would keep signing up very simple, almost to an “in your face” level, as our research showed that the older generations simply aren’t willing to spend time searching for things that they need when online. We wanted to make it painfully obvious where to go in order to get what you need when on the site.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col" id="line3">
                        <p>
                            Once we had the foundation of the redesign figured out, it was time to address the legibilty issues of the site. We decided to change the color scheme slightly to make sure that we were always meeting AAA standards, as well as did some background research to find optimal font sizes for those with visual disabilites. We created a new style for the site that would fulfill all of these standars.

<!--This is the prototype section-->
        <div class="prototype">
            <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
            <p>
                After going through our design process we had a final prototype that greatly increased the accessibility for A Little Help’s main demographic. The process of signing up for memebership was very easy to follow and AAA accessibility standards were followed to make sure that anyone who might need the help could find their way to it. We believe that were this design implemented it would greatly increase the success rate of people trying to sign up for the services that A Little Help is offering.
